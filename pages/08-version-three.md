Version 3 of the entire field manual package was released in March 2024. In addition to minor updates on most field manuals, three new field manuals were developed (see Table 4). The introductory chapter was also updated, including a new section on Indigenous partnerships and engagement. The website was revised to reflect all Version 3 updates including the expanded list of collaborators from the new field manuals.
