After the release of the Version 1 of the field manual package in early 2018, efforts were focussed on outreach to increase the adoption of the field manuals by the broader marine science community in Australia, as well as industry, regulators, and policymakers. This was done initially through conference presentations and face-to-face meetings, with follow-up meetings and questionnaires to gauge the success of adoption. Outreach and engagement efforts were focussed on establishing institutional uptake of the field manuals, rather than just individual uptake. This ensures the continuity and long-term applicability of the SOPs even if advocating individuals leave an agency. Ultimately, institutional uptake will maximise the comparability of datasets from various surveys, thus increasing the amount of comparable data able to be applied to national products and syntheses. 

The field manuals are not just applicable to the Australian community; they are also valuable to the international community, both regarding their content and the process used to develop them. The latter was addressed in a scientific journal paper (Przeslawski et al 2019a), while the content is available through the international searchable Ocean Best Practice Repository (www.oceanbestpractices.org) (Pearlman et al 2019).  


Resources were available to develop a Version 2 of this field manual package following additional community consultation and input. There will eventually be a need to develop subsequent versions for the following reasons:
Keeping up with technological advances to ensure uniformity of data acquisition across multiple agencies over time is a challenge for some platforms, particularly those that are based on rapidly advancing technology (e.g. AUV, MBES). In order to ensure that field manuals include relevant advances, they should be periodically checked and revised, lest they become superseded or obsolete.

A long-term plan for managing the field manuals has not yet been developed, with the exception of the multibeam field manual which will be overseen by AusSeabed. Efforts are still needed to establish a high-level oversight committee to develop and implement actions needed for future versions and to strengthen institutional uptake. At the time of writing this introduction, the most likely groups for this responsibility are the National Marine Science Committeeâ€™s Monitoring and Environmental Baseline working group, the AODN and/or a future version of the NESP Marine Hub.
