In this section, we generally describe some of the protocols that span all sampling platforms. Further detail on each of these is also provided in each chapter, as it is specifically relevant to a given sampling platform.
Sampling design
There are several overarching issues related to sampling design across all marine sampling platforms (e.g. randomisation, efficient designs, and uncertainty). We strongly encourage users of any field manual contained in this package to read Chapter 2 to familiarise themselves with these issues. 

Permits
Prior to undertaking any marine survey, researchers are responsible for ensuring appropriate applications for permission are lodged, with subsequent relevant approvals obtained and documented. A list of potential permissioning documents relevant to marine sampling in Commonwealth waters are listed in Appendix A.

Risk Assessments
Risk assessments not only help quantify potential risks associated with planning and field activities, they can help make fieldwork safer and reduce costs. They may also be a requirement for some organisations. It is recommended that a risk assessment is completed during the survey planning
