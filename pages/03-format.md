In order to maximise uptake, methods in each field manual are usually presented as simple steps. All steps listed are considered essential unless they are clearly marked with brackets and italics as recommended (i.e. Use netsonde or bottom contact sensor to ensure sled or trawl is suitably deployed along the seafloor _[Recommended]_)

The field manual package is designed to be separated into its component chapters representing discrete sampling platforms, as needed. For this reason, the package can be downloaded in its entirety as a single pdf, or as standalone chapters representing discrete field manuals (Figure 1). References will be listed accordingly at the end of each chapter.
